// Arrow Function Rule of THIS
/* 
If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, 
it ignores all the rules above and receives the this value 
of its surrounding scope at the time it’s created. 
To determine what this is, go one line above the arrow function’s creation 
and see what the value of this is there. 
It will be the same in the arrow function.
